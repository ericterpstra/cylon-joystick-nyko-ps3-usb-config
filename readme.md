# Nyko PS3 Controller Config for cylon-joystick

If there are any other people in the world using a Nyko USB PS3 Controller with Cylon.js, here is a joystick config file.
The 'home' button does not seem to register, but all other buttons and axes work.

All you really need is the nyko.json file in your project.  To run the sample program, clone this git repo and do a `npm install`. Then run `node test-joystick.js`.

I've only tested this with OS X Yosemite, but it should work with Windows.  I have no idea about linux, but perhaps it will work with the SDL library.
